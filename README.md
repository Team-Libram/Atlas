# Specification <br />

  Create an informational system representing a library. The program should collect and process records about books and readers. The system should allow simultaneous user access. <br />
  
  The system should support two types of users: Administrators, Operators and Readers (general users). The different types of users should have differentiating roles and access levels to the program's functionality. <br />
  
  General program functionality associated with accounts: <br />
    • Creation of operator accounts by administrators. <br />
    • Creation and unsubscribing of readers by operators. <br />
    • User form, used to create a reader's profile. <br />
    • Renting of books. <br />
    
  General program functionality associated with books: <br />
    • Addition of new books (incl. inventory number, title, author and genre). <br />
    • Retiring of damaged/worn out books. <br />
    • Archival of old books (used only in the reading room). <br />
    • Renting of books (with different security levels based on the book's condition - for takeout or only for the reading room). <br />
    • Returning of rented books. <br />
    
  The system should be able to generate the following reports: <br />
    • Submitted reader forms (incl. date, status and the form details). <br />
    • Books (incl. book condition and information). <br />
    • Users (incl. admission date, rented and/or read books and user information). <br />
    • Reader rating (loyal and non-loyal readers). <br />
    
  Notification system: <br />
    • Notifications about new reader forms (incl. notifying the reader of his form's status, notifying administrators about new forms). <br />
    • Notifications about book archival and/or retirement. <br />
    • Notifications about overdue book rental period.  <br />
